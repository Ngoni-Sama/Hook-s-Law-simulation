# Hook-s-Law-simulation
simulation for hook's law lab experiment

in this project:
Hook's law la experiment is simulated

requirements:
1.The user should be able to drag one of the weights and move 	it freely inside the interactive element
2.The weight can only be dropped in the holder .
3.If the weight is dropped anywhere else, it should go back to 	the pile.
4.There should be a reasonable snap radius inside which the weight snaps into place.
5.Numbers should be inserted in the table of results
6.The spring should not expand instantaneously into the new length, but it should stretch over a period of time (e.g 0.5 sec.).
7.The spring should swing few times before it comes to rest.
8.The user should be able to move the weights back from the holder to the table by dropping the weights outside of the snap radius.
